Introduction\\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have recently\\ndelivered impressive results (Ye et al., 2021; Hafner et al.,\\n2023; Schwarzer et al., 2023) in traditional benchmarks\\n(Bellemare et al., 2013; Tassa et al., 2018). In light of the\\nevermore complex domains tackled by the latest generations\\nof generative models (Rombach et al., 2022; Achiam et al.,\\n2023), the prospect of training agents in more ambitious\\nenvironments (Kanervisto et al., 2022) may hold signifi-\\ncant appeal. However, that leap forward poses a serious\\nchallenge: deep RL architectures have been comparatively\\nsmaller and less sample-efficient than their (self-)supervised\\ncounterparts. In contrast, more intricate environments ne-\\ncessitate models with greater representational power and\\nhave higher data requirements.\\n*Equal contribution1University of Geneva, Switzerland.

Copyright 2024 by\\nthe author(s).Model-based RL (MBRL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) is hy-\\npothesized to be the key for scaling up deep RL agents\\n(LeCun, 2022). Indeed, world models (Ha & Schmidhuber,\\n2018) offer a diverse range of capabilities: lookahead search\\n(Schrittwieser et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2021), learning in imag-\\nination (Sutton, 1991; Hafner et al., 2023), representation\\nlearning (Schwarzer et al., 2021; D’Oro et al., 2023), and un-\\ncertainty estimation (Pathak et al., 2017; Sekar et al., 2020).\\nIn essence, MBRL shifts the focus from the RL problem to\\na generative modelling problem, where the development of\\nan accurate world model significantly simplifies policy train-\\ning. In particular, policies learnt in the imagination of world\\nmodels are freed from sample efficiency constraints, a com-\\nmon limitation of RL agents that is magnified in complex\\nenvironments with slow rollouts.\\nRecently, the IRIS agent (Micheli et al., 2023) achieved\\nstrong results in the Atari 100k benchmark (Bellemare et al.,\\n2013; Kaiser et al., 2020). IRIS introduced a world model\\ncomposed of a discrete autoencoder and an autoregressive\\ntransformer, casting dynamics learning as a sequence mod-\\nelling problem where the transformer composes over time a\\nvocabulary of image tokens built by the autoencoder. This\\napproach opened up avenues for future model-based meth-\\nods to capitalize on advances in generative modelling (Ville-\\ngas et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023), and has already been\\nadopted beyond its original domain (comma.ai, 2023; Hu\\net al., 2023). However, in its current form, scaling IRIS to\\nmore complex environments is computationally prohibitive.\\nIndeed, such an endeavor requires a large number of tokens\\nto encode visually challenging frames. Besides, sophisti-\\ncated dynamics may require to store numerous time steps\\nin memory to reason about the past, ultimately making the\\nimagination procedure excessively slow. Hence, under these\\nconstraints, maintaining a favorable imagined-to-collected\\ndata ratio is practically infeasible.\\nIn the present work, we introduce ∆-IRIS, a new agent\\ncapable of scaling to visually complex environments with\\nlengthier time horizons. ∆-IRIS encodes frames by attend-\\ning to the ongoing trajectory of observations and actions,\\neffectively describing stochastic deltas between time steps.\\nThis enriched conditioning scheme drastically reduces the\\nnumber of tokens to encode frames, offloads the determinis-\\ntic aspects of world modelling to the autoencoder, and lets\\nthe autoregressive transformer focus on stochastic dynamics.\\n1arXiv:2406.19320v1  [cs.LG]  27 Jun 2024'),\n",

Discrete autoencoder of IRIS (Micheli et al., 2023) (left) and ∆-IRIS (right). IRIS encodes and decodes frames independently,\\nmeaning that zthas to carry all the information necessary to reconstruct xt. On the other hand, ∆-IRIS’ encoder and decoder are\\nconditioned on past frames and actions, thus ztonly has to capture what has changed and that cannot be inferred from actions, i.e. the\\nstochastic delta. This conditioning scheme enables us to drastically reduce the number of tokens required to encode a frame with minimal\\nloss (K≪KI), which is critical to speed up the autoregressive transformer that predicts future tokens.\\nNonetheless, substituting the sequence of absolute image\\ntokens with a sequence of ∆-tokens makes the task of the\\nautoregressive model more arduous. In order to predict the\\nnext transition, it may only reason over previous ∆-tokens,\\nand thus faces the challenge of integrating over multiple\\ntime steps as a way to form a representation of the current\\nstate of the world. To resolve this issue, we modify the\\nsequence of the autoregressive model by interleaving contin-\\nuous I-tokens, that summarize successive world states with\\nframe embeddings, and discrete ∆-tokens.\\nIn the Crafter benchmark (Hafner, 2022), ∆-IRIS exhibits\\nfavorable scaling properties: the agent solves 17 out of\\n22 tasks after 10M frames of data collection, supersedes\\nDreamerV3 (Hafner et al., 2023) at multiple frame bud-\\ngets, and trains 10 times faster than IRIS. In addition, we\\ninclude results in the sample-efficient setting with Atari\\ngames. Through experiments, we provide evidence that ∆-\\nIRIS learns to disentangle the deterministic and stochastic\\naspects of world modelling. Moreover, we conduct ab-\\nlations to validate the new conditioning schemes for the\\nautoencoder and transformer models.\\n2. Method\\nWe consider a Partially Observable Markov Decision Pro-\\ncess ( POMDP ) (Sutton & Barto, 2018). The transition,\\nreward, and episode termination dynamics are captured\\nby the conditional distributions p(xt+1|x≤t, a≤t)and\\np(rt, dt|x≤t, a≤t), where xt∈ X =R3×h×wis an im-\\nage observation, at∈ A ={1, . . . , A }a discrete action,\\nrt∈Ra scalar reward, and dt∈ {0,1}indicates episode\\ntermination. The reinforcement learning objective is to finda policy pπ(at|x≤t, a<t)that maximizes the expected sum\\nof rewards Eπ[P\\nt≥0γtrt], with discount factor γ∈(0,1).\\nLearning in imagination (Sutton, 1991; Sutton & Barto,\\n2018) consists of 3 stages that are repeated alternatively:\\nexperience collection, world model learning, and policy\\nimprovement. Strikingly, the agent learns behaviours purely\\nwithin its world model, and real experience is only leveraged\\nto learn the environment dynamics.\\nIn the vein of IRIS (Micheli et al., 2023), our world model\\nis composed of a discrete autoencoder (Van Den Oord et al.,\\n2017) and an autoregressive transformer (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017; Radford et al., 2019), albeit with new conditioning\\nschemes and architectures. We first expose IRIS’ world\\nmodel in Section 2.1, then present ∆-IRIS’ autoencoder and\\nautoregressive model in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, respectively.\\nFinally, we describe the policy improvement phase in Sec-\\ntion 2.4. Appendix A gives a detailed breakdown of model\\narchitectures and hyperparameters.\\n2.1.

Unrolling dynamics over time. At each time step (separated by dashed lines), the GPT-like autoregressive transformer Gpredicts\\nthe∆-tokens for the next frame, as well as the reward and a potential episode termination. Its input sequence consists of action tokens,\\n∆-tokens, and I-tokens, namely continuous image embeddings that alleviate the need to attend to past ∆-tokens for world modelling.\\nMore specifically, an initial frame x0is embedded into I-token ˜x0. From ˜x0anda0,Gpredicts the reward ˆr0, episode termination\\nˆd0∈ {0,1}, and in an autoregressive manner ˆz1= (ˆz1\\n1, . . . , ˆzK\\n1), the∆-tokens for the next frame.

The model is\\ntrained with a cross-entropy loss on segments sampled from\\npast experience.\\nAt a high level, the autoencoder builds a vocabulary of image\\ntokens to encode each frame, and the transformer captures\\nthe environment dynamics by autoregressively composing\\nthe vocabulary over time. As a result, this world model\\nis capable of attending to previous time steps to make its\\npredictions, and models the joint law of future latent states.\\n2.2. Disentangling deterministic and stochastic\\ndynamics\\nIRIS (Micheli et al., 2023) encodes frames independently,\\nmaking no assumption about temporal redundancy within\\ntrajectories. One major drawback of this general formu-\\nlation is that, in environments with visually challenging\\nframes, a large number of tokens is required to encode\\nframes losslessly. Consequently, computations with the dy-\\nnamics model become increasingly prohibitive, as the atten-\\ntion mechanism scales quadratically with sequence length.\\nTherefore, limiting computation under such a trade-off may\\nresult in degraded performance (Micheli et al. (2023) app.\\nE)One possible solution to achieve fast world modelling with\\nminimal loss is to condition the autoencoder on previous\\nframes and actions. Intuitively, encoding a frame given pre-\\nvious frames consists in describing what has changed, the\\ndelta, between successive time steps. In many environments,\\nthe delta between frames is often much simpler to describe\\nthan the frames themselves. As a matter of fact, when\\nthe transition function is deterministic, adding previous ac-\\ntions to the conditioning of the decoder results in a world\\nmodel, without the need to encode any information between\\ntime steps. However, most environments of interest feature\\nstochastic dynamics, and apart from aleatoric uncertainty,\\narchitectural limitations such as the agent’s memory may\\ninduce additional epistemic uncertainty. Hence, the delta\\nbetween two time steps usually consists of deterministic and\\nstochastic components.\\nFor instance, an agent moving from one square to another\\nin a grid-like environment when pressing movement keys\\ncan be seen as a deterministic component of the transition.\\nOn the other hand, the sudden apparition of an enemy in\\na nearby square is a random event. Interestingly, only the\\nstochastic features of a transition should be encoded, and\\nthe autoencoder could directly learn to model the determin-\\nistic dynamics, which do not require the expressivity and\\nability to handle multimodality of an autoregressive model.\\nTherefore, when autoenconding frames by conditioning on\\nprevious frames and actions, a frame encoding may only\\nconsist of a handful of ∆-tokens, instead of a large number\\nof image tokens describing frames independently.\\nSection 3.4 provides empirical evidence that ∆-IRIS’ autoen-\\ncoder learns to encode frames in such fashion, and Figure 1\\nillustrates the new conditioning scheme of the autoencoder.\\n3'),\n",

Evidence of dynamics disentanglement. Two trajectories are imagined with different ways of generating ∆-tokens. In the top\\ntrajectory, ∆-tokens are sampled randomly. In the bottom trajectory, the autoregressive transformer predicts future ∆-tokens. The same\\nstarting frame ( t= 0) and sequence of actions are used. With random ∆-tokens, the deterministic aspects of the dynamics (layout,\\nmovement, items, crafting) are still properly modelled, but the stochastic dynamics (mobs, health indicators) become problematic. For\\ninstance, the agent successfully cuts down a tree between t= 4andt= 5, and uses wood planks to build a crafting table between t= 10\\nandt= 12 . We observe that these dynamics are modelled in the same way whether ∆-tokens are sampled randomly or not. However, in\\nthe top trajectory, large quantities of cows appear and disappear from the screen incoherently, whereas the bottom trajectory does not\\ndisplay such erratic patterns. This experiment shows that ∆-IRIS encodes stochastic deltas between time steps with ∆-tokens, and its\\ndecoder handles the deterministic aspects of world modelling. Appendix F contains additional examples.\\nMore formally, for any set Y, we denote Sn(Y) =Sn\\ni=1Yi\\nthe set of tuples of elements from Yof maximum length\\nn, andS(Y) =S∞(Y).

The encoder is param-\\neterized by a Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN) (Le-\\nCun et al., 1989). Actions are embedded with a learnt\\nlookup table and concatenated channel-wise with frames.\\nWe use vector quantization (Van Den Oord et al., 2017;\\nEsser et al., 2021) with factorized and normalized codes\\n(Yu et al., 2021) to discretize the encoder’s continuous\\noutputs. The CNN decoder D:S(X × A )× ZK→ X\\nreconstructs an image ˆxtfrom past frames, actions and ∆-\\ntokens (x0, a0, . . . , x t−1, at−1, zt). Action and ∆-tokens\\nare embedded with learnt lookup tables, and concatenated\\nchannel-wise with feature maps obtained by forwarding\\nframes through an auxiliary CNN.\\nThe discrete autoencoder is trained on previously collected\\ntrajectories with a weighted combination of L1,L2and\\nmax-pixel (Anand et al., 2022) reconstruction losses, as\\nwell as a commitment loss (Van Den Oord et al., 2017). The\\ncodebook is updated with an exponential moving average\\n(Razavi et al., 2019) and we use a straight-through estimator\\n(Bengio et al., 2013) to enable backpropagation.2.3. Modelling stochastic dynamics\\nWhile it should be possible to predict future ∆-tokens, given\\na starting image, past actions and ∆-tokens, we found this\\ntask much more difficult than simply predicting future image\\ntokens, given past image tokens and actions, as in IRIS.\\nTo better understand why this is the case, let us consider\\nanother example: in a grid environment, ∆-tokens may\\ndescribe the unpredictable movement of an enemy, ran-\\ndomly jumping from one square to another at every time\\nstep. Based on the initial enemy location and after only a\\nfew time steps, it becomes increasingly difficult to predict\\nif the enemy and the agent are located on the same square,\\nwhich could trigger a battle and make the enemy disap-\\npear. Indeed, situating the two entities involves reasoning\\nabout the initial observation, and integrating over all of the\\nprevious action and ∆-tokens, which may have a complex\\ndependence structure.\\nTo address this problem, we alter the sequence of the dynam-\\nics model by interleaving continuous I-tokens, in reference\\nto MPEG’s I-frames (Richardson, 2004), and discrete ∆-\\ntokens. I-tokens alleviate the need of integrating over past\\n∆-tokens to form a representation of the current state of\\nthe world, i.e. they deploy a “soft” Markov blanket for the\\nprediction of the next ∆-tokens.\\n4'),\n",

Happiness and well-being: Finding joy, contentment, and fulfillment in life.\\n\\n2. Love and relationships: Forming meaningful connections with others.\\n\\n3. Personal growth: Continuously learning, improving, and developing as an individual.\\n\\n4. Contribution to society: Making a positive impact on the world and helping others.\\n\\n5. Self-realization: Discovering and fulfilling one's potential and purpose.\\n\\n6. Religious or spiritual fulfillment: Following a particular faith or spiritual path.\\n\\n7. Experiencing and appreciating existence: Living in the present moment and finding beauty in the world.\\n\\n8. Creating meaning: Actively constructing purpose and significance in one's own life.\\n\\n9. Survival and reproduction: Fulfilling biological imperatives.\\n\\n10. Seeking knowledge and understanding: Pursuing truth and wisdom.\\n\\nUltimately, the meaning of life is a personal journey of discovery, and individuals may find different answers based on their experiences, beliefs, and values.

    "\n",
    "- RAG Stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "- A RAG Pipeline consists of a few different parts, which all work together to allow a language model to generate reliable and accurate information based on retrieved context.\n",
    "- We pass through the users query and the retrieved context dynamically to a language model by filling in a prompt template.\n",
    "- The prompt template leverages a LLMs ability to follow system level instructions when directed and the fact that we can pass through content as variables to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prompt Template Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "Your job is to answer the user's query using only the provided context.\n",
    "Keep your answer grounded in the facts of the provided context.\n",
    "If the context does not contain the facts needed to answer the user's query, return: \"I do not have enough information available to accurately answer the question.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Context:\n",
    "{context}\n",

    "#### How does the context actually get retrieved?\n",
    "- We take our external documents (PDFs, CSVs, TXTs etc.) and use **some heuristic** to split the text (perhaps splitting after *n* number of characters or based on the tags in a programming language if we are splitting code text).\n",
    "- If our splits are too small, say, if we decided to split on sentences, we can combine a few sentences together to create a ***chunk*** of text.\n",
    "- We take our chunks of text and pass them through a ***sentence embedding*** model, and we upload the embedding vectors to a vector database.\n",
    "- Now, when a user enters a query, if we encode that query using the same embedding model, we can then perform a ***cosine similarity*** search between all the vectors in the database with respect to the users query vector, and then retrieve the ***top-k*** most similar chunks of text.\n",
    "- If we save the retrieved context to a `context` variable, we can easily send that through to the prompt template in addition to the users query and let the model generate the response."
